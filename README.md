# Eliminating surgical pain

Surgery is not easy for everyone. It brings discomfort and often involves significant post-surgical pain.

Currently, patient pain is frequently managed through the use of **narcotics that bring a bevy of unwanted side effects**.

Our solution aims to improve pain management through the use of indwelling catheters that block or mitigate pain at the source before the surgery begins.

Pain management catheters reduce dependence on narcotics and speed up patient recovery.

In our solution, we identify and segment a collection of nerves called the **Brachial Plexus (BP)** in ultrasound images. 

Our model  build a model can identify **nerve structures in a dataset of ultrasound images of the neck**. Doing so would improve catheter placement and contribute to a painless surgery.
